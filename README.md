Python wrapper for the Walking Fish Group test problems
-------------------------------------------------------

* The directory  WFG_v2006.03.28 contains the C++ code for the problems as
  downloaded from http://www.wfg.csse.uwa.edu.au/toolkit/index.html#source

* The wrapper code expects to find a directory WFG with the C++ code.
  Ensure that a symbolic link from WFG_v2006.03.28 to WFG exists or rename
  the directory or fiddle with the wrapper code ...

* Build and install with 
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
